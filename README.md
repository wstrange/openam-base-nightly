# 
Dockerfile for OpenAM Nighly build


THis deployes the OpenAM war in Tomcat 8 and is ready to be configured

Note: for OpenAM to be configured correctly the container must resolve the FQDN DNS name used to access OpenAM.

One way to do this is to use the --add-host command on docker run. For example:

docker run -i -t -p 8080:8080 --add-host "openam.example.com:127.0.0.1" wstrange/openam-base-nightly 

If you get an error where the configurator complains that it can not start OpenDJ, or assigns negative port numbers (-1)
the container this is likely the issue.
